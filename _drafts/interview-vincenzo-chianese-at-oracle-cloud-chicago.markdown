We joined thousands of developers, architects and technical executives for Oracle Cloud conference in Chicago. During the trip, Vincenzo Chianese, engineer for LunchBadger (co-sponsor of Express Gateway), shared an expert workshop in partnership with Auth0 and had the chance for a live interview.

## Auth0 & LunchBadger
As part of our conference participation, we shared the spotlight with one of our favorite community partners, Auth0. Previously, we collaborated on a [popular blog post about the important role of API Gateways and Microservices](https://auth0.com/blog/apigateway-microservices-superglue/). When the opportunity came up to share this with a live audience, we packed up our bags and headed to Chicago. Thanks, again, to Auth0 and keep a lookout because we'll share the slides and video!
