We get asked a lot - How can I contribute? What is Express Gateway all about? Well, here's your chance to check out what other developers are talking about and prioritizing when it comes to what they'd like to see in the next generation API Gateway. If you're looking to make an impact on a popular open source project, read on, upvote or just share your feedback. Let's go!

## Built by Devs for Devs on Express.js

Let's start with the important stuff. This week we [released 1.8.0 with some eagerly awaited features](https://www.express-gateway.io/whats-inside-express-gateway-1-dot-8-0/), including a brand new consolidated Docker Image. This is important for everyone out there who has implemented or used Docker so check out the updates on that. 

Also, on that same note - we are actively working towards joining the [official Docker images program](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/). So keep an eye out. 

There are still a lot of opportunities to contribute, maintain or just provide general community support. If you're interested, we're [growing the roadmap](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/milestones).

## Interview with Bob Rhubart, OTN Architect community manager. He is also the editor and producer of [Archbeat Podcast](https://feeds2.feedburner.com/OtnArch2Arch).

In addition to a [step-by-step getting started technical guide](https://www.express-gateway.io/getting-started-with-json-web-tokens-and-express-gateway/), weâ€™ve also put together a video tutorial on setting up JSON Web Tokens. Whether you are initiating JSON Web Tokens by other identity servers, like Auth0, or when you actually initiate and manage the JWTs through an Identity Server - we've got you covered.

## Environment Variables

Exploring the ins-n-outs of environment variables? We [added support for environment variables](https://www.express-gateway.io/getting-started-with-environment-variables-and-express-gateway/) in Express Gateway and created a step-by-step guide and video walkthrough of how to get started.

## Inhale the Good Gateway

After [releasing the latest 1.7.3](https://www.express-gateway.io/express-API-gateway-update-03112018/), we've gotten a great response and also quite a few questions about what's next. Given that this project is being put to work by developers in production environments, this is a very important question. 

So, you can always learn more about upcoming features and releases by checking out the **[Express Gateway Roadmap.](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/milestones)** Something you may not see in there is for 1.7.4 - we're going to be making some noise about Docker. With the latest major updates, it's going to be a big one and we'll share more details as the updated Docker images.


## What Else? A little something special.

In addition to all of the great How-Tos, we've put together a more in depth look about getting the important metrics you need, when you need them. As a reminder, we've created a nice visual so you can understand how requests are routed.

In [this technical rundown](https://www.express-gateway.io/application-specific-metrics-using-express-gateway/), you can see how to scaffold a Plugin, use an API Gateway to to add application specific metrics. By the end, you'll be able to expose the metrics through an HTTP endpoint that can be queried by an external service, such as Prometheus.

So, you can also read all about [how to get it into production](https://www.express-gateway.io/application-specific-metrics-using-express-gateway-in-production/) with a live example.

## Moving On

Code snippets, guides and videos are just the start of something great. It's time to go build something great! We'd love to know more about how you're putting this open source, API Gateway to work.
