It's true, we've slowed down on Express Gateway. Why? We've been pretty busy supporting developers deploying instances of Express Gateway on production environments. We are thrilled at this opportunity, but like any other open source project we've found a few edge cases. So, where to go from here? 

<!--excerpt-->

Please welcome Express Gateway 1.7.3 where we have collected some edge cases and put solutions to those edgecases into this release. 

### Reminder: In Production yet?

If you're currently using Express Gateway in production - [hit us up](mailto:info@express-gateway.io)! We'd love to understand more about your use case, project and see where we could help out.
