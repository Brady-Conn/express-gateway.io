It's true, we've slowed down on Express Gateway. Why? We've been pretty busy supporting developers deploying instances of Express Gateway on production environments. We are thrilled at this opportunity, but like any other open source project we've found a few edge cases. So, where to go from here?

<!--excerpt-->

Please welcome Express Gateway 1.7.3 where we have collected some edge cases and put solutions to those edgecases into this release.

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT) got an upgrade

Last week we posted all about getting started with JSON Web Tokens, so this release has some extra special love for JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 

Now, when you validate an external JWT and `checkCredentialExistence` flag is `false`, the gateway will set the received JWT as the current user object. This makes it easy to directly extract the information you care about instead of creating an anonymous user. 

* It is now possible to specify the `algorithm` parameter that the `oAuth2` policy will use to sign the provided JWT token

## JSON Schema support still in full swing

Express Gateway's schema validator (`ajv`) has now the coercing option enabled. This means that the gaetway will try to convert your data to the correct type whenever is possible. This was required to fully support environment variables in JSON configuration files. [#659](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/659)

JSON Schema for the `serviceEndpoint` has been improved with regards of the `urls` [#661](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/661)

Just in case a plugin's JSON schema is wrong or if there are issues while registering it on Express-Gateway, you'll still get the original error message.

## How We're Making Your Dev Life Easier

* When a policy cannot be loaded, for any reason, an error message will now be shown on the screen so you should know what's happening in an easier way [#640](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/640)

* The environment variable support permitted us to remove a small hack we were doing in our test code to check the Redis support [#644](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/644)

* Proxy policy has beed reorganized a bit so it's easier to read and reason about it
