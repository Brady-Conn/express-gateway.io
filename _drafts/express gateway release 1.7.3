It's true, we've slowed down on Express Gateway. Why? We've been pretty busy supporting developers deploying instances of Express Gateway on production environments. We are thrilled at this opportunity, but like any other open source project we've found a few edge cases. So, where to go from here?

<!--excerpt-->

Please welcome Express Gateway 1.7.3 where we have collected some edge cases and put solutions to those edgecases into this release.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Last week we posted all about getting started with JSON Web Tokens, so this release has some extra special love for JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 

Now, when you validate an external JWT and `checkCredentialExistence` flag is `false`, the gateway will set the received JWT as the current user object. This makes it easy to directly extract the information you care about instead of creating an anonymous user. 

* It is now possible to specify the `algorithm` parameter that the `oAuth2` policy will use to sign the provided JWT token

JSON Schema

Express-Gateway's schema validator (`ajv`) has now the coercing option enabled. This means that the gaetway will try to convert your data to the correct type whenever is possible. This was required to fully support environment variables in JSON configuration files. [#659](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/659)

JSON Schema for the `serviceEndpoint` has been improved with regards of the `urls` [#661](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/661)

In case a plugin's JSON schema is wrong or there's any problem while registering it on the Express-Gateway, the original error message will be correctly propagated. [#664](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway/pull/664)

### Reminder: In Production Yet?
